        <p class="bio">Hello, my name is William Small, Im a pretty laid back guy that always enjoys a challenge. When
            Im not working, I enjoy
            spending time with my wife, Stephanie, aas well as our dog and two cats. I love anything and everything
            outside, however my favorite
            activites include hiking, fishing, and camping. I graduated from Radford University in May 2012, with a
            bachelors in Marketing. I enjoy
            bringing and applying my skillsets as well as adapting new ones for a company. I look forward to speaking to
            you in the near future.
